# Dagger Online

A stab at making an online game with node.js backend. Why node.js? Because it's fun to use, 
easy to prototype with, easy to scale, and cheap to host

Technologies used:
## Client:
  * Unity
  * Basic Socket.io implementation (websockets)
  
##Server:
  * Gulp - task runner
  * Typescript - typesafe javascript
  * Mocha / chai - testing framework
  * Socket.io - connection
  * MongoDB / Mongoose - database
  * lodash - functional programming stuff
  * node.js - for all the cool stuff
